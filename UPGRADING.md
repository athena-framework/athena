# Upgrading

The Athena ecosystem generally follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) pattern, but with some nuances due to its pre-1.0 status.
Minor releases are reserved for major breaking changes, usually along side new large features/refactors.
Patch releases contain backwards compatible features, bug fixes, and small breaking changes that are unlikely to affect the average user.
In either case, the changes you need to make in order to upgrade will be documented in files like this one; located within each component's [repository](https://github.com/orgs/athena-framework/repositories?q=topic%3Acomponent&type=source&language=crystal&sort=name) as applicable.
