The source code for the Mercure Bundle is located in [src/bundles/mercure](../../bundles/mercure).
The documentation is located here due to limitations with the [Projects](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/projects/) MkDocs Material plugin.
This inconsistency will hopefully be resolved via Zensical's [Subprojects](https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#subprojects) feature at some point in the future.
