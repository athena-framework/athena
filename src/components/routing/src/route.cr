# Provides an object-oriented way to represent an HTTP route,
# including the path, methods, schemes, host, and/or conditions required for it to match.
#
# Ultimately, `ART::Route`s are compiled into `ART::CompiledRoute` that represents an immutable
# snapshot of a route, along with `ART::CompiledRoute::Token`s representing each route parameter.
#
# By default, a route is very liberal in regards to what allows when matching.
# E.g. Matching anything that matches the `path`, but with any HTTP method and any scheme.
# The `methods` and `schemes` properties can be used to restrict which methods/schemes the route allows.
#
# ```
# # This route will only handle `https` `POST` requests to `/path`.
# route1 = ART::Route.new "/path", schemes: "https", methods: "POST"
#
# # This route will handle `http` or `ftp` `GET`/`PATCH` requests to `/path`.
# route2 = ART::Route.new "/path", schemes: {"https", "ftp"}, methods: {"GET", "PATCH"}
# ```
#
# ## Expressions
#
# In some cases you may want to match a route using arbitrary dynamic runtime logic.
# An example use case for this could be checking a request header, or anything else on the underlying `ART::RequestContext` and/or `ART::Request` instance.
# The `condition` property can be used for just this purpose:
#
# ```
# route = ART::Route.new "/contact"
# route.condition do |context, request|
#   request.headers["user-agent"].includes? "Firefox"
# end
# ```
#
# This route would only match requests whose `user-agent` header includes `Firefox`.
# Be sure to also handle cases where headers may not be set.
#
# WARNING: Route conditions are _NOT_ taken into consideration when generating routes via an `ART::Generator::Interface`.
#
# ## Parameters
#
# Route parameters represent variable portions within a route's `path`.
# Parameters are uniquely named placeholders wrapped within curly braces.
# For example, `/blog/{slug}` includes a `slug` parameter.
# Routes can have more than one parameter, but each one may only map to a single value.
# Parameter placeholders may also be included with static portions for a string, such as `/blog/posts-about-{category}`.
# This can be useful for supporting format based URLs, such as `/users.json` or `/users.csv` via a `/users.{_format}` path.
#
# ### Parameter Validation
#
# By default, a placeholder is happy to accept any value.
# However in most cases you will want to restrict which values it allows, such as ensuring only numeric digits are allowed for a `page` parameter.
# Parameter validation also allows multiple routes to have variable portions within the same location.
# I.e. allowing `/blog/{slug}` and `/blog/{page}` to co-exist, which is a limitation for some other Crystal routers.
#
# The `requirements` property accepts a `Hash(String, String | Regex)` where the keys are the name of the parameter and the value is a pattern
# in which the value must match for the route to match. The value can either be a string for exact matches, or a `Regex` for more complex patterns.
#
# Route parameters may also be inlined within the `path` by putting the pattern within `<>`, instead of providing it as a dedicated argument.
# For example, `/blog/{page<\\d+>}` (note we need to escape the `\` within a string literal).
#
# ```
# routes = ART::RouteCollection.new
# routes.add "blog_list", ART::Route.new "/blog/{page}", requirements: {"page" => /\d+/}
# routes.add "blog_show", ART::Route.new "/blog/{slug}"
#
# matcher.match "/blog/foo" # => {"_route" => "blog_show", "slug" => "foo"}
# matcher.match "/blog/10"  # => {"_route" => "blog_list", "page" => "10"}
# ```
#
# ### Optional Parameters
#
# By default, all parameters are required, meaning given the path `/blog/{page}`, `/blog/10` would match but `/blog` would _NOT_ match.
# Parameters can be made optional by providing a default value for the parameter, for example:
#
# ```
# ART::Route.new "/blog/{page}", {"page" => 1}, {"page" => /\d+/}
#
# # ...
#
# matcher.match "/blog" # => {"_route" => "blog_list", "page" => "1"}
# ```
#
# CAUTION: More than one parameter may have a default value, but everything after an optional parameter must also be optional.
# For example within `/{page}/blog`, `page` will always be required and `/blog` will _NOT_ match.
#
# `defaults` may also be inlined within the `path` by putting the value after a `?`.
# This is also compatible with `requirements`, allowing both to be defined within a path.
# For example `/blog/{page<\\d+>?1}`.
#
# TIP: The default value for a parameter may also be `nil`, with the inline syntax being adding a `?` with no following value, e.g. `{page?}`.
# Be sure to update any type restrictions to be nilable as well.
#
# ### Priority Parameter
#
# When determining which route should match, the first matching route will win.
# For example, if two routes were added with variable parameters in the same location, the first one that was added would match regardless of what their requirements are.
# In most cases this will not be a problem, but in some cases you may need to ensure a particular route is checked first.
#
# ### Special Parameters
#
# The routing component comes with a few standardized parameters that have special meanings.
# These parameters could be leveraged within the underlying implementation, but are not directly used within the routing component other than for matching.
#
# * `_format` - Could be used to set the underlying format of the request, as well as determining the [content-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) of the response.
# * `_fragment` - Represents the fragment identifier when generating a URL. E.g. `/article/10#summary` with the fragment being `summary`.
# * `_locale` - Could be used to set the underlying locale of the `ART::Request` based on which route is matched.
#
# ```
# ART::Route.new(
#   "/articles/{_locale}/search.{_format}",
#   {
#     "_locale" => "en",
#     "_format" => "html",
#   },
#   {
#     "_locale" => /en|fr/,
#     "_format" => /html|xml/,
#   }
# )
# ```
#
# This route supports `en` and `fr` locales in either `html` or `xml` formats with a default of `en` and `html`.
#
# TIP: The trailing `.` is optional if the parameter to the right has a default.
# E.g. `/articles/en/search` would match with a format of `html` but `/articles/en/search.xml` would be required for matching non-default formats.
#
# ### Extra Parameters
#
# The defaults defined within a route do not all need to be present as route parameters.
# This could be useful to provide extra context to the controller that should handle the request.
#
# ```
# ART::Route.new "/blog/{page}", {"page" => 1, "title" => "Hello world!"}
# ```
#
# ### Slash Characters in Route Parameters
#
# By default, route parameters may include any value except a `/`, since that's the character used to separate the different portions of the URL.
# Route parameter matching logic may be made more permissive by using a more liberal regex, such as `.+`, for example:
#
# ```
# ART::Route.new "/share/{token}", requirements: {"token" => /.+/}
# ```
#
# Special parameters should _NOT_ be made more permissive.
# For example, if the pattern is `/share/{token}.{_format}` and `{token}` allows any character, the `/share/foo/bar.json` URL will consider `foo/bar.json` as the token and the format will be empty.
# This can be solved by replacing the `.+` requirement with `[^.]+` to allow any character except dots.
#
# Related to this, allowing multiple parameters to accept `/` may also lead to unexpected results.
#
# ## Sub-Domain Routing
#
# The `host` property can be used to require the HTTP [host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) header to match this value in order for the route to match.
#
# ```
# mobile_homepage = ART::Route.new "/", host: "m.example.com"
# homepage = ART::Route.new "/"
# ```
#
# In this example, both routes match the same path, but one requires a specific hostname.
# The `host` parameter can also be used as route parameters, including `defaults` and `requirements` support:
#
# ```
# mobile_homepage = ART::Route.new(
#   "/",
#   {"subdomain" => "m"},
#   {"subdomain" => /m|mobile/},
#   "{subdomain}.example.com"
# )
# homepage = ART::Route.new "/"
# ```
#
# TIP: Inline defaults and requirements also works for `host` values, `"{subdomain<m|mobile>?m}.example.com"`.
