# Athena's Routing component, `ART` for short, allows mapping HTTP requests to particular `ART::Route`s.
# This component is primarily intended to be used as a basis for a routing implementation for a framework, handling the majority of the heavy lifting.
#
# The routing component supports various ways to control which routes are matched, including:
#
# * Regex patterns
# * [host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) header values
# * HTTP method/scheme
# * Request format/locale
# * Dynamic callbacks
#
# Using the routing component involves adding `ART::Route` instances to an `ART::RouteCollection`.
# The collection is then compiled via `ART.compile`.
# An `ART::Matcher::URLMatcherInterface` or `ART::Matcher::RequestMatcherInterface` could then be used to determine which route matches a given path or `ART::Request`.
# For example:
#
# ```
# # Create a new route collection and add a route with a single parameter to it.
# routes = ART::RouteCollection.new
# routes.add "blog_show", ART::Route.new "/blog/{slug}"
#
# # Compile the routes.
# ART.compile routes
#
# # Represents the request in an agnostic data format.
# # In practice this would be created from the current `ART::Request`.
# context = ART::RequestContext.new
#
# # Match a request by path.
# matcher = ART::Matcher::URLMatcher.new context
# matcher.match "/blog/foo-bar" # => {"_route" => "blog_show", "slug" => "foo-bar"}
# ```
#
# It is also possible to go the other way, generate a URL based on its name and set of parameters:
#
# ```
# # Generating routes based on route name and parameters is also possible.
# generator = ART::Generator::URLGenerator.new context
# generator.generate "blog_show", slug: "bar-baz", source: "Crystal" # => "/blog/bar-baz?source=Crystal"
# ```
#
# See the related types for more detailed information.
