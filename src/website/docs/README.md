Athena was created with the intention of providing various high quality, reusable, and independent [components](components/README.md) that can be used for things such as serialization, validation, dependency injection, etc. These components can be used on their own within a standalone application, or as a means to "build" a framework. The design principles of Athena take heavy inspiration from various other frameworks including [Symfony](https://symfony.com/what-is-symfony), and [Spring](https://spring.io/why-spring). Athena Framework is the result of integrating the components in the Athena ecosystem into one cohesive framework.

## Feature Overview

In regards to other Crystal web frameworks, Athena employs some unique concepts, features, and design principles:

* Annotations, including user-defined ones, are used to define & configure routes among other things
* Adheres to the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles; basing its dependencies on interfaces, and providing a [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) Service Container to help manage dependencies/ease testing
* Event based; allows tapping into various events during the life-cycle of a request
* Flexible foundation; can make an application as simple or complex as needed, using only the features/components that are needed
